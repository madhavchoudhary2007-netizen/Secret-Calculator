SECRET NOTES CALCULATOR APP

Goal: Build a web calculator that appears normal but hides a secret notes vault when triggered.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Core Calculator UI:
- Professional calculator layout with display screen
- Number pad: 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), = button, C (clear), DEL (delete last digit)
- Display shows current input and result
- History section above main display showing previous calculations

Secret Trigger Mechanism:
- User types exact sequence: 6 → 9 → / → 6 → 7
- When complete AND user presses =: No calculation shown
- App immediately switches to Secret Notes screen
- To return to calculator: User types any digit (0-9) in notes screen

Calculator Functionality:
- All non-secret equations calculate correctly (2 + 2 = 4, 15 * 3 = 45)
- Handle decimal points (10 / 3 = 3.333...)
- Handle operator precedence (2 + 3 * 4 = 14, NOT 20)
- Handle chained operations (5 + 3 - 2 = 6)

Notes Management (Secret Screen):
- Create new note with text input + save button
- List all saved notes
- Edit note: click note to open edit mode, update text, save
- Delete note: button to remove from list
- Auto-save notes to localStorage (persist after page reload)

Calculator History:
- Display above main input line, scrollable
- Show last 10 valid calculations: "5 * 5 = 25", "10 + 3 = 13" format
- DO NOT log secret code attempts (69/67) to history
- Clear history when user clears calculator (C button)

Data Persistence:
- Notes: stored in localStorage as JSON array
- History: stored in localStorage (optional, improves UX)
- Both persist across page reloads

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript only (NO frameworks like React, Vue, Angular)
- Single file (index.html with embedded CSS/JS) or organized folder structure
- Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- Clean, professional calculator aesthetic

BEFORE BUILDING - Please explain:
1. How will you detect the 69/67 sequence without triggering calculation?
2. What state management approach will you use (calculator vs notes mode)?
3. What's the localStorage JSON structure for notes?
4. How will you handle operator precedence (2 + 3 * 4 = 14)?
